# Manga Distribution Program - TC1031.602

## Description

### Problematic Identified
Manga specialized stores as Panini Points or Barnes & Noble receive a continous income and outcome of stories as the customers take them and distribution points send them, keeping a continous movement in bookshelves where througout the store every manga is organized alphabetically based on their title. Processes as the restocking, finding and selling specific manga volumes require of a complete understanding of the bookshelf distribution and the mangas' position making in hard for both employees and customers (even if finding the right volume is also part of the fun).

This problems and the desire to implement order can also occur to individual collectionist making difficult to know the location of specific stories and avaliable free space for more stories.

### Objective
The present system allows to read a series of volume tomes, order them based on different keys,  add and eliminate volumes from the collection, and search for specific volumes location based in an infinite number of bookshelfs and its interior shelfs taking into account the standard measurements of a manga volume and the avaliable space in a traditional Panini's bookshelf. As an additional feature this program can store the information once ordered to keep track of the collection without losing the work done.

Measurements of a standard Manga Volume:

Mangas width ranges between 1 - 3 cm depending on the edition, editorial, and story, therefore the user will be able to enter the width of each volume to have a precise calculation.

Total capacity of mangas per individual shelf: 140 volumes ~ 2 m (two sections of 70 each volume with an average width of 1.5 cm or 0.015 m = 1.05 ~ 1 m).
Total capacity of mangas per whole manga's shelf: 560 volumes being a total of 8 m avaliable in one bookshelf.


### Personal interest
This system would allow not only to keep mangas in order in an specified place, but also search for them based on the data. As an amateur manga collector I am interested in keeping my volumes in order and in a specific place.
